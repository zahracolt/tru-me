## About Tru-Me

**Tru-Me** is a smart mirror that uses AI and machine learning technology to provide personalized skincare recommendations.
The smart mirror would use high-resolution cameras and sensors to analyze the user's skin in real-time, identifying any imperfections, such as wrinkles, fine lines, dark spots, or redness. It would then provide personalized skincare recommendations based on the user's skin type, age, and other factors, such as climate and environment.
The smart mirror would have an integrated display that shows the user how their skin would look after applying the recommended skincare products. It would also offer a virtual try-on feature that allows the user to experiment with different makeup looks, shades, and textures.
To ensure inclusivity, the smart mirror could incorporate a range of skin tones, textures, and ages in its analysis and recommendations. It could also offer voice commands and gesture-based controls to make it easier to use for people with mobility impairments.
The smart mirror could also connect with the user's smartphone or wearable device, allowing them to track their skincare routine, set reminders, and receive alerts when it's time to replenish their skincare products. It could also provide information on the ingredients and sustainability of the recommended products to cater to the growing number of consumers who value these attributes in their skincare products.
Overall, this smart mirror could revolutionize the beauty industry by providing personalized and inclusive skincare recommendations that cater to the individual needs and preferences of consumers, while also enhancing the overall beauty experience.

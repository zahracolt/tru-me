## About Tru-Me

**Tru-Me** is a smart mirror that uses AI and machine learning technology to provide personalized skincare recommendations.
The smart mirror would use high-resolution cameras and sensors to analyze the user's skin in real-time, identifying any imperfections, such as wrinkles, fine lines, dark spots, or redness. It would then provide personalized skincare recommendations based on the user's skin type, age, and other factors, such as climate and environment.
The smart mirror would have an integrated display that shows the user how their skin would look after applying the recommended skincare products. It would also offer a virtual try-on feature that allows the user to experiment with different makeup looks, shades, and textures.
To ensure inclusivity, the smart mirror could incorporate a range of skin tones, textures, and ages in its analysis and recommendations. It could also offer voice commands and gesture-based controls to make it easier to use for people with mobility impairments.
The smart mirror could also connect with the user's smartphone or wearable device, allowing them to track their skincare routine, set reminders, and receive alerts when it's time to replenish their skincare products. It could also provide information on the ingredients and sustainability of the recommended products to cater to the growing number of consumers who value these attributes in their skincare products.
Overall, this smart mirror could revolutionize the beauty industry by providing personalized and inclusive skincare recommendations that cater to the individual needs and preferences of consumers, while also enhancing the overall beauty experience.

## Inspiration
The beauty industry is rapidly evolving, and consumers are demanding more personalized and inclusive beauty experiences. We were inspired by the idea of creating a smart mirror, called **Tru-Me**, that uses AI and machine learning technology to provide personalized skincare recommendations, catered to the individual needs and preferences of consumers.

## What it does
**Tru-Me** uses high-resolution cameras and sensors to analyze the user's skin in real-time, identifying any imperfections, such as wrinkles, fine lines, dark spots, or redness. It provides personalized skincare recommendations based on the user's skin type, age, and other factors, such as climate and environment. It also offers a virtual try-on feature that allows the user to experiment with different makeup looks, shades, and textures.

## How we will built it
To build **Tru-Me**, we will use a Raspberry Pi 4 and connect it to high-resolution cameras and sensors. We will utilize machine learning algorithms and computer vision techniques to analyze the user's skin and provide personalized skincare recommendations.  It will also offer voice commands and gesture-based controls to make it easier to use for people with disabilities to use. We will develop a custom software application, using Python, OpenCV, and TensorFlow which can be connected to the mirror.

## Challenges we will run into
We will face several challenges during the development of Tru-Me. One of the most significant challenges will be the accurate analysis of the user's skin in real-time. We will have to experiment with different camera angles and lighting conditions to ensure that the analysis will be accurate and consistent. We will also have to train our machine learning algorithms on a diverse range of skin tones, textures, and ages to ensure inclusivity.

## Accomplishments that we will be proud of
We will be proud of creating a smart mirror that provides personalized skincare recommendations based on the user's individual needs and preferences. We will also be proud of developing a virtual try-on feature that allows users to experiment with different makeup looks, shades, and textures. Finally, we'll be proud of incorporating diverse skin tones, textures, and ages in our analysis and recommendations to ensure inclusivity.

## What we will learn
Through the development of Tru-Me, we will learn about the challenges and opportunities of using AI and machine learning technology to provide personalized and inclusive beauty experiences. We'll also learn about the importance of accuracy and consistency in skin analysis and the need to incorporate diverse skin tones, textures, and ages in our analysis and recommendations. Finally, we will learn about the potential of technology to revolutionize the beauty industry and enhance the overall beauty experience for consumers.

## What's next for the Tru-Me
Tru-Me has the potential to revolutionize the beauty industry by providing personalized skincare recommendations and virtual try-on features. Here are some potential next steps for the smart mirror:

1. Incorporate more skincare products: Tru-Me could be updated to include a wider range of skincare products and brands, allowing users to choose from a more extensive selection of products.

2. Integrate with wearable devices: Tru-Me could be integrated with wearable devices such as fitness trackers, to provide more accurate skincare recommendations based on the user's activity levels, sleep patterns, and other health data.

3. Develop a mobile app: A mobile app could be developed to work in conjunction with Tru-Me, allowing users to access their skincare recommendations, track their skincare routine, and receive alerts when it's time to replenish their skincare products.

4. Expand to other beauty categories: The technology used in the smart mirror could be applied to other beauty categories such as hair care, nail care, and fragrance, providing personalized recommendations based on the user's individual needs and preferences.

5. Improve accessibility: The smart mirror could be updated to include more accessibility features such as voice commands, text-to-speech, and gesture-based controls, making it easier for people with disabilities to use.

Overall, Tru-Me has the potential to continue evolving and improving, providing consumers with personalized and inclusive beauty experiences that cater to their unique needs and preferences.
